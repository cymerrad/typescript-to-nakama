# Typescript to Nakama-accepted Lua

This is a very minimalistic project skeleton, that gives you choice over what you want to use, in order to code the behaviour of your Nakama server.  
Lua becomes very unwieldy after hitting its critical mass value of 2-3 files. In contrast, Typescript is maintainable and offers a lot of benefits, like **type safety**, **editing support** in almost every editor and access to great tools from **Node toolchain**.  
At the time of creating this project (September 2018), Nakama's documentation was (idk about now, tbh) severly lacking. I had to discover most of the types and behaviours from source-code or by experimentation.

# TODO's

1. Legal stuff: licences, am I using some trademarks?
2. Decent human stuff: explicit shoutout and thanks to people behind [TypescriptToLua](https://github.com/Perryvw/TypescriptToLua) and [Nakama](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama)
3. More documentation
4. More content (e.g. lib declarations)
